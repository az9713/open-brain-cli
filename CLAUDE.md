# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

Open Brain CLI is a CLI-first personal AI memory system — one database (Supabase + pgvector), one CLI tool (`ob`), any AI. This repo provides the `ob` CLI for direct terminal access, plus extensions, recipes, schemas, dashboards, integrations, and comprehensive docs. Originally based on [Open Brain by Nate B. Jones](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1).

**License:** FSL-1.1-MIT. No commercial derivative works.

## Repo Structure

```
extensions/     — Curated, ordered learning path (6 builds). Do NOT add without maintainer approval.
primitives/     — Reusable concept guides (must be referenced by 2+ extensions). Curated.
recipes/        — Standalone capability builds. Open for community contributions.
schemas/        — Database table extensions. Open.
dashboards/     — Frontend templates (Vercel/Netlify). Open.
integrations/   — MCP extensions, webhooks, capture sources. Open.
docs/           — Setup guides, FAQ, companion prompts.
resources/      — Claude Skill, companion files, ob CLI tool.
```

Every contribution in recipes/schemas/dashboards/integrations/extensions/primitives must live in its own subfolder and include `README.md` + `metadata.json`.

## Guard Rails

- **Never modify the core `thoughts` table structure.** Adding columns is fine; altering or dropping existing ones is not.
- **No credentials, API keys, or secrets in any file.** Use environment variables.
- **No binary blobs** over 1MB. No `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`.
- **No `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE`, or unqualified `DELETE FROM`** in SQL files.

## Architecture — The Two Access Paths

Open Brain has two ways to access the same Supabase PostgreSQL database:

```
MCP path (GUI clients like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT):
  AI Client → MCP Server (Edge Function) → OpenRouter + Supabase PostgreSQL

CLI-Direct path (terminal tools like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI):
  AI Tool → ob CLI (bash, curl+jq) → OpenRouter + Supabase PostgreSQL
```

Both paths read/write the same `thoughts` table and are fully interoperable. The `ob` CLI tool lives at `resources/ob-cli/ob` and provides 7 commands: `capture`, `search`, `recent`, `delete`, `stats`, `check`, `version`. CLI-captured thoughts include `"source": "ob-cli"` in metadata.

The core data flow for both paths: user text → OpenRouter embedding (text-embedding-3-small) + metadata extraction (gpt-4o-mini) → INSERT into `thoughts` table with pgvector embedding.

## Automated PR Review

`.github/workflows/ob1-review.yml` runs 13 checks on every PR to `main`. Key rules:

- PR title must start with `[category]` (e.g., `[recipes]`, `[docs]`)
- Branch convention: `contrib/<github-username>/<short-description>`
- Commit prefixes: `[category]` matching contribution type
- Contributions need `README.md` + valid `metadata.json` (see `.github/metadata.schema.json` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for required fields)
- `[docs]` prefix or PRs that don't touch contribution dirs skip contribution checks
- Contribution README must include: Prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, expected outcome sections
- Category-specific: schemas need `.sql`, dashboards need frontend code, extensions need both `.sql` and code, primitives need 200+ word README
- Declared `requires_primitives` must exist in `primitives/` and be linked in README
